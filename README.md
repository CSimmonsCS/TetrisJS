# TetrisJS
Tetris game made with Javascript.  Matrices are used to interpret the game board and the blocks.  The user blocks are generated from an array of the required tetris blocks.  Functions were created to draw matrices, merge the game board with the player block, detect when the lines are to be cleared, prevent blocks from going pass the edges off the board, blocks from colliding with each other, moving the playing, reseting the game, rotating the character block, and drop the user tetris block as a second of time passes.  Action listeners are listening to the left, right, &amp; up arrow keys for movement, as well as, 'q' &amp; 'w' for rotation direction.
